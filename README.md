# Illescas_Independent_Project

#For my **Final Project** I wanted to practice two things: 

##1. *Making presentations using RStudio*
##2. *Practice what will eventually be my proposal*

##I did not think that this project was difficult except when trying to add more to a slide and make sure it wasn't overlapping anything.  There are still things I want to learn to do, but so far I am very happy with how much I have learned.  This course has not only taught me how to code using R, RMarkdown, it also taught me how to create an html, a pdf, a presentation, a shiny app, a read me file, which I completely forgot to do for my independent project. 

#The most important things I learned during this course were:

##1. I need to balance the classes I take while doing research.  Had I known, I would have taken prosem a different semester. 
##2. In order to learn how to code, you really have to make time to practice. 
###3. Ask for help when you need it.  Both you and Emily were extremely kind and helpful when it came to answering questions and needing for time to finish projects.  I have not had the privelige of always having understanding professors, and it wasn't until the end of the course that I realized I could have asked for help a lot sooner. 
##4. It is a lot harder to code on your own.  Some of the labs took me a really long time, but it was just because I had missed those lectures and even though what you say in class is in the presentation, it just is not the same.  Also, both you and Emily are in class to help, which honestly makes a world of a difference. 

##This final project was not as hard as I thought it would be, but I didn't realize how much I ha learned even though I had missed many lectures.  I felt that "xaringan" was very intuitive and easy to use, so thank you for suggesting that. 

#**Overall, this class was awesome.  I never in my life imagined myself coding, and even less, enjoying it!  Thank you so much for all your help, I am truly grateful to you for having grace and understanding the pressures and stressors of my life.**
