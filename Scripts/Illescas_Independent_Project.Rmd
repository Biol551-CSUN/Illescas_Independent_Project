```{r, echo=FALSE}
# (class: center, middle) allows us to center anything from text to photos, I happen to like the uniformity of having things centered. Below we are calling an image which has been taken directly from the internet.  Making sure to find a quality .png or .jpeg is important so picture does not appear blurry.

```

# **Phytocannabinoids**
### *Cannabis Sativa* plants produce **glandular trichomes** which contain disk cells that release secretions into a cavity, where secondary metabolites, such as cannabinoids, are deposited and stored.

##### (Just like essential oils!)

# the number of hashtags "###" allows us to assing the size of font we want to see, the less hashtags, the larger the font!

---
class: center, middle

## Paraquat (PQ) Exposure
-Incubate during 12 hour PQ exposure

--

-Exchange PQ for respective diets

--

-Incubate for 36 hours

--

-Prepare for dissection

---
class: center, middle

## Dissection Takes Place 48 Hours after PQ Exposure
